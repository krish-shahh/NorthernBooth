##### General
A bunch of 'new' technology has been used within Photobooth.JS:

* [WebRTC] - To communicate with the webcam
* [Browserify] - For managing the dependencies within Javascript
* [Shader] - For generating the effects (much faster!!)
* [HTML 5 Audio] - To make this nice flash sounds if you take a photo
* [Canvas] - To display the actual webcam data
* [HTML 5 - FileAPI] - To save the photos taken by the webcam

##### Frameworks
Photobooth.JS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [jQuery] - :) 
* [Seriously.JS] - A nice Framework for working with the camera + some neat effects that one can apply
* [Browserify] - I've worked with require.JS for too long, it was time for something new. Here it is. And it's great
* [Ion Sound] - Great Sound-Plugin for jQuery with some nice free sounds included
* [Grunt] - What else??
* [Handlebars] - Templating engine
* [Jasmine] - For testing purposes
* [Node.Js] - While developing
